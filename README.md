## Why Resume&CV?
It's **simple**. CSS is the easiest way to stylize your document to be **pleasing to eye**. Moreover, conversion to PDF from HTML **keeps your hyperlinks**, so your final CV can be a bit more interactive.

## How To Use It?
Find the best CV/resume HTML template inside [templates](/templates) directory. Then replace LoremIpsum fields to your own data. Template design is based on CSS classes, so all you have to do is change one class to another. Then if your CV is ready, open template file in your local browser. You should see something similar to the picture at the top of the page. Right click on the page and select `Print` option (or simply press `CTR + P`). Then, inside printing menu change some options to the ones below and press `Save`. Voil√†!
- [X] Destination PDF
- [ ] Margins
- [x] Background graphics

**Attention!** Take care that your data fit into single page. If not, add new section with `pageA4` class or use one of multi-page templates.

## For rest of the Population
Basically, you can prepare your CV with only changing LoremIpsum fields to your own data. This doesn't require you to dive deep into HTML. But if you have some free time, you can read about HTML tags most often used in our templates: 
[\<div\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div), 
[\<p\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p),
[\<h1\>-\<h6\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements),
[\<ul\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul),
[\<table\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table),
[\<img\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img).
